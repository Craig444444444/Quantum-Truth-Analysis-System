# Quantum Truth Analysis System

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AFL--3.0%20with%20restrictions-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview
The Quantum Truth Analysis System is an advanced framework for evaluating claims through multi-agent debate and axiomatic truth analysis. This system employs specialized agents (FactChecker, Scientist, Logician, Historian, and AxiomRegulator) to analyze evidence, debate perspectives, and determine truth probabilities with visual mapping of reasoning pathways.

## Features
- **Multi-Agent Debate Architecture**: Five specialized agents with unique analytical approaches
- **Axiomatic Framework Integration**: Evaluate claims against scientific, historical, and ethical frameworks
- **Evidence Evaluation Engine**: Analyze source reliability, scientific consensus, and historical patterns
- **Visual Reasoning Mapping**: Generate interactive debate visualization graphs
- **Transformation Pathways**: Identify steps to reconcile conflicting truths
- **Scalable Analysis**: Supports 100-page evidence analysis across 100 debate cycles

## Installation
```bash
pip install quantum-truth
```

## Usage
```python
from quantum_truth import TruthAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = TruthAnalyzer(pages=100, cycles=100)

# Analyze claims
results = analyzer.analyze("Is the Earth flat?", framework="Scientific_Empirical")
```
