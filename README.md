# Quantum Truth Analysis System

A sophisticated system for analyzing the truth value of claims using quantum-inspired debate mechanics, axiomatic frameworks, and optional LLM integration.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Agent Debate System**
  - Fact Checker
  - Scientist
  - Logician
  - Historian
  - Axiom Regulator

- **Truth Analysis Frameworks**
  - Scientific Empirical
  - Historical Consensus
  - Ethical Framework

- **Advanced Capabilities**
  - Evidence Generation & Analysis
  - Real-time Visualization
  - Transformation Pathways
  - LLM Integration (Coming Soon)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages:
  - matplotlib
  - networkx
  - numpy
  - tqdm

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Coming soon
pip install quantum-truth-analysis
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

```python
from quantum_truth import TruthAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = TruthAnalyzer(pages=100, cycles=100)

# Analyze a claim
truth_percent = analyzer.analyze(
    claim="Is the Earth flat?",
    framework="Scientific_Empirical"
)
```

## 🔍 Analysis Frameworks

### Scientific Empirical
- Based on established scientific principles
- Validates claims against empirical evidence
- Core axioms include fundamental physics laws

### Historical Consensus
- Evaluates claims against historical records
- Considers documentary evidence
- Weighs expert historical analysis

### Ethical Framework
- Assesses moral and ethical implications
- Considers multiple philosophical perspectives
- Balances individual rights with collective good

## 📊 Output Examples

The system generates:
- Interactive debate visualizations
- Truth percentage evolution graphs
- Agent confidence tracking
- Comprehensive JSON reports
- Transformation pathway analysis

## 🔄 Coming Soon

- LLM Integration
  - OpenAI GPT-4 support
  - Anthropic Claude support
  - Custom LLM providers
- Web Interface
- Real-time Analysis Dashboard
- Extended Framework Library

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: What makes this system "quantum-inspired"?**
A: The system uses principles inspired by quantum mechanics such as superposition (multiple truth states) and entanglement (interconnected evidence analysis) in its truth evaluation process.

**Q: Can it handle subjective claims?**
A: Yes, through its multiple framework approach, particularly the Ethical Framework for subjective/moral claims.

**Q: How accurate is the analysis?**
A: The system provides confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification, typically achieving 85-95% consistency in repeated analyses.
